# Grover's Search Algorithm  

![Image of the circuit](Grover's%20Search%20Algorithm%202.0%20with%20tordles.png)
  
This is my implementation of the Grover search algorithm on Qiskit.  

My presentation on how the algorithm works: [Using a Quantum Computer to Find Good Luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14jMBpbLzBg)  


**Note**  

The code works perfectly on the QASM simulator with a 94% accuracy...

...but fails on the real IBM quantum computer due to decoherence.
